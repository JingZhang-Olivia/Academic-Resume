abstract: This study aims to forecast international tourist arrivals to Hong Kong from seven English-speaking countries. A new direction in tourism demand modeling and forecasting is presented by incorporating tourist-generated online review data related to tourist attractions, hotels, and shopping markets into the destination forecasting system. The main empirical findings indicate that tourism demand forecasting based on touristsâ€™ online review data can substantially improve the forecasting performance of tourism demand models; specifically, mixed data sampling (MIDAS) models outperformed competing models when high-frequency online review data were included in traditional time-series models.
