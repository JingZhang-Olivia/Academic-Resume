abstract: Although ‘staycation’ has become a buzzword during the COVID-19 pandemic, research on staycation experiences is still limited. This paper conducts a fine-grained sentiment analysis integrated with a factor extraction approach to explore the positive and negative factors influencing the staycation experience in Hong Kong hotels. Using online reviews of staycations, this study builds an ordered logit model to determine the influences of these factors on customers’ staycation experiences and reveals the heterogeneous effects between different types of hotels and customer segments. This study contributes to the limited hotel staycation experience literature and provides important managerial implications for hotels that target local residents for the growing staycation market.
