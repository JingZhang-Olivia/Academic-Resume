abstract: 
The presence of hosts' profile photo on peer-to-peer accommodation platforms is likely to influence consumers' judgments and purchase behavior. Based on the stimulus–organism–response theory and mental imagery theory, this study examines the existence and mechanisms of beauty premium via experimental designs. Results indicate that consumers tend to book and pay more for an accommodation offered by an attractive host, and these effects are mediated by potential consumers' perceived enjoyment and threats regarding their future stay. The study also highlights two factors that can weaken consumers' reliance on hosts' facial attractiveness when making purchase decisions: hosts' reputation and self-disclosure. This study enriches the literature on the beauty premium and ways to reduce consumers' reliance on hosts' facial attractiveness.
